<h1>About us</h1>
<p>Ever make a bet with someone after a few beers and then one day they pounded on your door demanding you to pay up and you didn't have the cash on you but, ya know, you were good for it they just didn't believe you (for the 3rd time in a row) so they got a little aggressive and started making threats to you and your new car ("you had enough money to buy a NEW CAR?!" he says) and then you end up getting your tires slashed, windshield bashed in, and left eye busted up all because you (a) drank a few too many beers that one thursday night in october last year and (b) failed to record the bet on that awesome app called "betties"?  Yeah, it's never happened to us either...</p>
